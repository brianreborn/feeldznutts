# LESSONS-LEARNED.md

> **Status note (2026-10-09):** earlier content was a coding agent's private session notes (artifact paths, tool names) and claimed files and regression tests that did not exist. It has been replaced with project lessons.

## L1. Renames leave a long tail (#16)
Renaming feeldznutts → familia left the installer, docs, log prefixes and the logo pointing at the old name. Grep for the old name in code *and* docs, and replace assets in the same change.

## L2. Agent context must match the server slot (#19)
hermes-agent with compression off sent ~18–21k-token requests to a 16,384-token `coder` slot and looped on HTTP 400. Fix: declare both in `graph.yaml`, require `context_length` == per-slot ctx, and launch hermes through `scripts/hermes.sh` with compression on.

## L3. Escaped quotes break shell scripts silently (#14)
A stray `\"` left `android_start.sh` unparseable. Run `sh -n` / shellcheck in CI.

## L4. Never pack a small host's RAM (2026-10-09)
miryam (7 GiB) hard-hung when the 64k coder server, an embed test and a compaction self-test ran together. Provisional guidance, not hard limits: `reserve_ram_mib: 3072`, ~2 GiB free after estimates, one heavy process at a time. These stay fuzzy until idle load is characterized and system-level OOM protection is deployed. See `docs/ram-safety.md`.

## L5. SSH passwords
Use key-only SSH to the phones; the android scripts read addr/user/port from graph.yaml (or ANDROID_HOST/USER/PORT) and never take passwords or disable host-key checking (#18).

## L6. Use ASCII in names and code
Non-breaking hyphens (U+2011) in file names and Python expressions break copy-paste. Keep identifiers ASCII.

## L7. Android Vulkan needs the system loader
Termux's Vulkan loader only sees llvmpipe. llama.cpp finds the phone GPU (Xclipse 550) only when LD_LIBRARY_PATH holds both libvulkan.so and libvulkan.so.1 linked to /system/lib64/libvulkan.so; familia-start does this. On the A57, SmolLM2-135M Vulkan -ngl 99 gives tg 66-79 t/s against 30 t/s on 3 CPU threads (#34).

## L8. Phones drop off Wi-Fi during long runs
Both A57s left the LAN (no route to host) minutes into a detached benchmark. Take termux-wake-lock and keep the screen-off Wi-Fi policy in mind before long runs, write results to a log on the phone, and poll with backoff instead of holding one SSH session open.

## L9. Same hardware is not same software
phone7 had Termux llama-cpp 0.5.0 while a fresh install on phone8 pulled 0.6.0. Record the runtime version with every benchmark before comparing phones.

## L10. A small iGPU can be slower than the CPU
On miryam the HD 620 runs SmolLM2-135M at 46 t/s tg, versus 101 on 2 CPU threads. Its value is offloading the decision model so the CPU stays free for the coder. When both ran together, though, the Vulkan side fell from 46 to 17 t/s tg, while the CPU coder held about 14 t/s (#24).


## L11. Measure once, look it up afterwards (model + hardware registry)
Each tuning round re-learned facts we already had: the A57 Vulkan loader fix, the iGPU being slower than miryam's CPU, contention on shared memory. Every measured result now goes into `registry/records.jsonl` (append-only, labelled measured or estimated), and the hardware setup facts go into shareable `registry/hardware/` profiles. `registry.py suggest` proposes a placement from those records instead of a new sweep, and `match` gives identical hardware the known-good setup. Watts are spec-sheet upper bounds until measured. See `docs/model-registry.md`.

## L12. LittleBit sub-1-bit models (#28, 2026-10-09)
- **QAT is not optional.** Upstream init alone (Dual-SVID, even with LittleBit-2 ITQ) on stories15M gives PPL 2.6e5–2.7e14 vs dense 1.88 (0% top-1). Per-layer relative output error at eff 1.0: 0.82 SVD-only, 0.68 ITQ. 300 CPU self-distillation steps (~6 min, 4 threads) bring it to PPL 6.31 (eff 1.0) and 6.98 (eff 0.1). Those numbers are a pipeline exercise on same-distribution text, not paper-grade.
- **At small widths the scales dominate.** eff 0.1 on 288-wide layers clamps to rank 8 and stores 0.224 bpw, because the F32 scales outweigh the signs. On K2-Horizon-0.9B-sized layers 0.1 really is ~0.11 bpw.
- **The dense parts decide the size.** After LittleBit, the embedding and an untied head are most of the file (stories15M: 71 of 71.3 MiB; K2-Horizon: 2×188 MiB f16 vs 11.6 MiB of linears). Plan the head's quant and placement first.
- **Keep upstream's bit layout** (int32, LSB first, bit 1 = −1). Conversion is then word copies, and the q/k rope permute only moves whole packed rows plus u1.
- **License:** upstream is CC BY-NC 4.0, so familia imports a user-supplied checkout and vendors nothing.
- **No public sub-1-bit checkpoints** from Samsung. "littlebit-qwen3-4b" GGUFs on HF are ordinary Q4/Q5/Q8.
- `rg PATTERN` with no path in a non-tty shell reads stdin and hangs. Always pass a path.

## L11. A57 sweep: what matters (phone8, llama-cpp 0.6.0, 2026-10-10)
With Vulkan -ngl 99 on SmolLM2-135M: Q4_0 gives the best tg (102 t/s, against 89 for Q8_0 and 83 for Q4_K_M). Flash-attn raises pp about 11% at equal tg. Threads 1, 2 and 3 are within noise once the GPU holds all layers. Batch and ubatch sizes stay within noise from 128 up (64 is about 15% slower on pp). Partial offload is worse than full: -ngl 24 gives 7 t/s tg, 16 gives 2.8, 8 gives 1.5. -ngl 0 with the Vulkan build loaded collapses to 0.2-0.8 t/s tg, so always use -ngl 99. Four back-to-back runs showed no thermal drift (tg128 80-82 t/s). Qwen2.5-0.5B Q4_K_M fits: tg 31-34 t/s, pp128 508, MemAvailable never below 1.9 GiB.

## L12. DHCP can swap phone addresses
After a reconnect, phone8 (u0_a414) answered on 192.168.1.7 with phone8's host key, and ssh refused it as a "changed host key". Confirm a device by its known host key plus its Termux user, and connect with HostKeyAlias, never by deleting known_hosts entries. Give the phones DHCP reservations.

## L-miryam-perf. On a 2-core laptop, use 2 threads, and the iGPU costs RAM (2026-10-10)
llama-bench on miryam (i5-7200U, 2C/4T, HD 620), Qwen3.5-2B Q4_K_M, CPU only, fa on, 2 reps, spread shown as +/-:

| setting | pp256 t/s | tg32 t/s |
|---|---|---|
| b11374, -t 4 | 29.4 +/-1.3 | 5.86 +/-0.27 |
| b11540 CPU, -t 4 | 31.6 +/-1.7 | 5.82 +/-0.18 |
| b11541 (Vulkan build, -dev none), -t 4 | 30.6 +/-0.9 | 6.26 +/-0.34 |
| b11541, **-t 2** | 32.4 +/-0.4 | **8.44 +/-0.06** |

LFM2.5-1.2B Q4_K_M: -t 2 pp 50.7 / tg 17.1; -t 3 47.4 / 15.2; -t 4 49.3 / 14.2.

- **Threads = physical cores.** Hyperthreads add contention on the shared FPU and memory path: -t 2 is +35% decode for the coder (+20% for LFM) and slightly faster prefill. The coder node now sets `threads: 2`.
- **Builds:** b11374, b11540 and b11541 are within noise. The coder stays on b11374, which is verified for qwen35.
- **KV type** (-d 1024, tg): f16 / q8_0 / q4_0 for K and V all land within 6.3-8.0 t/s at -t 4. That is inside the -t 4 noise, because Qwen3.5 is hybrid and has few full-attention layers. q8_0 stays for the 64k config. fa off was no faster (6.8).
- **ubatch** 128 / 256 / 512 at b 512: 32.3 / 33.0 / 32.9 t/s pp. No change from the default.
- **mmap flag:** this build renamed `-mmp` to `-lm` (load_mode), so it wasn't swept.
- **CPU clock:** it sits at 2.5 GHz on all cores under load, down from 3.1 GHz idle turbo. That's the 15 W limit. no_turbo=0, and turbo can't be adjusted without root.
- **iGPU and RAM:** every Vulkan run of the 2B coder (op-offload with -ngl 0, or -ngl 99) dropped MemAvailable from about 3.2 to 2.2-2.6 GiB. That tripped the 3 GiB guard within seconds, so the runs were killed before they produced numbers. On a shared-memory iGPU the driver allocates its own buffers in addition to the mmapped weights. Under the 3 GiB-free rule, the coder can't use the iGPU on miryam at all. Smaller models (LFM, embed) are tested for iGPU roles separately.
- **iGPU clock cap:** gt_max_freq_mhz (1000 MHz, min 300) isn't writable without root, and intel_gpu_top isn't installed, so a capped iGPU clock wasn't tested.


## numpy and pre-x86-64-v2 CPUs (qodesh, Athlon II X2), 2026-10-10
- numpy 2.4+ wheels crashed on import with 0xc000001d (illegal instruction). NumPy 2.4.0 raised the default x86 `cpu-baseline` to X86_V2 (SSE3, SSSE3, SSE4.1, SSE4.2, POPCNT, CX16, LAHF; see https://numpy.org/doc/stable/release/2.4.0-notes.html). The Athlon II X2 (K10) has SSE3, POPCNT and LAHF, but no SSSE3 and no SSE4.1/4.2, so it is v1.
- The cutoff is 2.4, not 2.0. NumPy 2.0-2.3 used an SSE3 baseline: **numpy 2.3.5 imports and passes all familia tests on qodesh (91 passed, 19 skipped).**
- `scripts/cpu_level.py` detects the level (`/proc/cpuinfo` flags, CPUID on Windows, sysctl on macOS). Non-x86 reports n/a. All three installers pick the numpy spec from the level alone: v0/v1 get `numpy<2.4`, everything else gets `numpy`. There are no OS-, host- or GPU-specific pins.
- numpy 2.4+ can still be built for v1: the docs say `-Csetup-args=-Dcpu-baseline=none` gives a build "compatible with all x86 CPUs" and relies on runtime dispatch, though pre-2009 SIMD paths are no longer maintained. Not built yet, because qodesh has no C compiler (no MSVC, gcc, clang or MSYS2).

## L-miryam-igpu. On miryam the iGPU loses to the CPU, even when it fits in RAM (2026-10-10)
A provisional guard killed any run that dropped free RAM below 3.5 GiB. That 3.5 GiB line is fuzzy guidance (see docs/ram-safety.md), so runs it killed were cautious stops, not proven unsafe. "delta" is how much free RAM fell during the run. Idle MemAvailable was only 3.7-4.2 GiB (desktop, Grok Bot app, other workers), so the room was 200-700 MiB.

| config | prompt t/s | generate t/s | RSS MiB | delta MiB | under 3.5 GiB? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| SmolLM2-135M, CPU, -t 2 | 340 | **110** | 253 | 55 | no |
| SmolLM2-135M, iGPU, -lm mmap, ub 128 | 331 | 51 | 194 | 136 | no |
| SmolLM2-135M, iGPU, -lm none, ub 128 | 332 | 50 | 116 | 144 | no |
| embeddinggemma-2 Q8, CPU, -t 2 | 195 | - | 741 | 360 | no |
| embeddinggemma-2 Q8, iGPU (4 variants) | - | - | 209-504 | 362-545 | 3 of 4 killed |
| LFM2.5-1.2B, iGPU or partial offload, -lm none, q4_0 KV, ub 128 | - | - | 111 | 644-900 | killed |
| LFM2.5-1.2B or Qwen3.5-2B, CPU alone | - | - | 1283 / 1604 | 258-533 | killed |
| CPU model + SmolLM2 on the iGPU (both combos) | - | - | - | 107-199 | killed (3.54-3.58 GiB) |
| Qwen3.5-2B, CPU, -t 2, server, no speculation | - | 8.7 | - | - | within target, min 3.48 GiB |
| same, `--spec-type ngram-mod` | - | 16.3 | - | - | within target, min 3.43 GiB |
| same, `--spec-type ngram-simple` | - | **17.4** | - | - | within target, min 3.44 GiB |

- **`-lm none` (no mmap) and the iGPU:** with no mmap, process RSS drops (116 vs 194 MiB for SmolLM2), but the free-RAM delta is the same. The driver's copy replaces the page-cache copy and doesn't add to it. A smaller ubatch saves about 40 MiB.
- **Speed:** the HD 620 is about half the CPU's decode speed even on a 135M model. That's consistent with decode being memory-bound on the shared DDR4 and 15 W budget, though nothing measured bandwidth or power directly. Every iGPU role tested was slower than the same work on the CPU, and none of them fit the coder within the 3.5 GiB target. The useful roles left are background prompt or embedding work with a tiny model while the CPU is otherwise idle.
- **Clock cap:** gt_max_freq_mhz isn't writable without root, so a capped clock wasn't testable.
- **Speculation:** n-gram lookup costs no weights and no measurable RAM. It doubled decode on a copy-heavy prompt, which is the best case. `coder-ngram` in graph.yaml is now `ngram-simple` and stays `planned` until it's measured on real hermes edits. The three server runs bottomed out at 3.43-3.48 GiB free. That counts as **within** the fuzzy ~3.5 GiB target, not a violation.
- **Draft-model speculation:** Qwen3.5-0.8B as a draft would cost about 530 MiB more, which breaks the floor. Not run.

## L-kvq8. Quantized KV on the A57 is a loss, and llama-bench changes its table shape (2026-10-10)
- Quantized V cache requires flash-attn. With `-fa 0 -ctv q8_0` llama.cpp refuses to create the context.
- With `-fa 1`, q8_0 KV works but is slower at 135M on Xclipse 550: tg 69.5 vs 101.6 t/s, pp 1225 vs 1468. Keep f16 KV on phones unless ctx RAM forces it.
- The earlier "silent" q8_0 failure was mostly our parser: when the KV type isn't f16, llama-bench adds `type_k`/`type_v` columns, so fixed-column parsing dropped those rows. Use `-o csv`/`-o json` and parse by column name.
- Sustained 5 min tg128 on phone8 drifts from ~85 to ~75 t/s after ~4 min (mild throttle). Thermal zones aren't readable from Termux. `termux-battery-status` hangs without the Termux:API app (the pkg alone isn't enough).
- Identify phones by host key plus boot_id, not address. Termux sshd ignores the login name, so the user isn't a reliable identifier.

## L-memcap. Cap model servers with a user scope; earlyoom and zram need one sudo paste (2026-10-10)
- `scripts/serve.sh <node>` wraps llama-server in `systemd-run --user --scope` with MemoryHigh 2200M, MemoryMax 2600M, MemorySwapMax 0 and oom_score_adj 800. No root is needed. It's on by default on miryam; `FAMILIA_MEMCAP=0` turns it off. It was verified on miryam with a SmolLM2 server.
- On miryam, sudo needs a password, so earlyoom and zram wait for the user's paste block in docs/ram-safety.md.
- systemd-oomd was already active as an Ubuntu default. We didn't configure it.
- The old swap was a 16 MiB partition, and it was full.
- Idle sampling showed miryam's processes pausing between agent commands: wall time on miryam moved far less than on the controller. The laptop probably suspends when idle. That would also explain the frequent "offline" drops, and it means detached jobs freeze rather than fail. Keep it awake (a ping, or `systemd-inhibit`) during long runs.
